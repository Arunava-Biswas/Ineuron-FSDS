    "In object-oriented programming, whenever we define methods for a class, we use `self` as the first parameter in each case. The `self` keyword is used to represent an instance (object) of the given class. \n",

    "However, since the class is just a blueprint, `self` allows access to the attributes and methods of each object in python. This allows each object to have its own attributes and methods. Thus, even long before creating these objects, we reference the objects as self while defining the class.\n",

    "Generally, when we call a method with some arguments, the corresponding class function is called by placing the method's object before the first argument. So, anything like `obj.meth(args)` becomes `Class.meth(obj, args)`. The calling process is automatic while the receiving process is not (its explicit).\n",

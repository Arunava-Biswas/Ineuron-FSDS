    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Some New Features Added in Python 3.8 Version are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walrus Operator:** This operator is used to assign and return a value in the same expression. This removes the need for initializing the variable upfront. The major benefit of this is it saves some lines of code. It is also known as **`The Walrus Operator`** due to its similarity to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`yield`** and **`return`** statements do not require parentheses to return multiple values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed works with a dictionary. The built-in method **`reversed()`** can be used for accessing the elements in the reverse order of insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dict comprehensions** have been modified so that the key is computed first and the value second. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**`importlib_metadata`** is a new library added in the Python’s standard utility modules, that provides an API for accessing an installed package’s metadata, such as its entry points or its top-level name.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings now support **`=`** , to make string interpolation easy. Python 3.8 allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal sign **`(=)`** inside the f-strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the three-argument form of **`pow()`**, when the exponent is -1, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the given value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`csv.DictReader`** now returns instances of dictionary instead of a **`collections.OrderedDict`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If someone misses a comma in their code such as a = **`[(1, 2) (3, 4)]`**, instead of throwing **`TypeError`**, it displays an informative Syntax warning. "

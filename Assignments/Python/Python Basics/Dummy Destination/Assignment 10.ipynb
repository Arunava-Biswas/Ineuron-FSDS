    "`shutil.copy()` method is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder, it primarily takes two arguments `src`,`dest`. `src` represents the file to be copied i.e. the source, whereas `dest` refers to the file/folder to where the src data should be copied to i.e. the destination. If `dest` is a folder name same as `src` with exact name will be copied to the `dest` folder, if its a file then the contents of `src` will be copied to `dest` where `dest` retains it's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copytree()` function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. it also takes two arguments `src` & `dest`. It copies all the content recursively and stores it in `dest`. The important catch here is `dest` must not exist prior to this operation and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied with `shutil.copystat()` and individual files are copied using `shutil.copy2()` by default which can be modified using `copy_function` attribute."

    "**Shutil** module provides a funciton called as `shutil.rmtree()` which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are `os.remove()` that removes a file, `os.rmdir()` removes an empty directory. The problem with these functions are once a file is deleted, it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file.\n",

These methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them, hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if the file is deleted using the `send2trash.send2trash()` function. send2trash is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules, it needs to be installed explicitly using the command `!pip install send2trash`."
